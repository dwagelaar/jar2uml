This is the binary distribution of the AmbientTalk/2 interpreter.

A quick tour of what's included:
- AmbientTalk 2.tmbundle: the TextMate support bundle, simply drag it on to TextMate, if you have that application installed.
- iat: the shell script that starts the interactive ambienttalk shell (iat).
- ambienttalk2.jar: the code for the AT/2 interpreter, preferably to be ran via the iat script
- at: the 'system library' that is shipped with the language. As a user, you can modify the files, but at your own risk :-)
- lib: external Java libraries for the interpreter

Do not forget to set the value of the AT_HOME environment variable when running iat from within TextMate.
